# IOS lunch God

## App Description
    Simple application to schedule Lunch/Dinner places in your calendar. 
    Create a group and share your events in their calendar. 
    Search Restaurant near by and create your lunch schedule with your friends.
## Personal Note:
    Created this application to test my IOS app development skills. I often go out to eat with my co-workers and wanted a simple way to schedule our lunch ahead of time. 
    I used Yelp api to search nearby restaurant and used IOS native calendar to schedule them. In order to share the same schedule, i used firebase to store all the events and automatically update or create the events on the user's phone whenever the app its open. I also included a chat room to message each other in the group.
    User Login is handled by Firebase authentication and IOS native face/finger authentication
